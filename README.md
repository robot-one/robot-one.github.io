Built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [my fork of Dream](https://github.com/Darthagnon/hugo-theme-dream), and [Darth's Hugo Shortcodes](https://github.com/Darthagnon/darths-hugo-shortcodes). External resources  are kept minimal; JS/CSS/HTML and images are loaded locally; external `iframes` have fallbacks in [the fallback folder](/static/img/fallback/).
