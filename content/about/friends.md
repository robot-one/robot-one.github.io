- [Wololo.net](https://wololo.net/); the Playstation Portable hacking blog that first got me interested in computer science and security research back in 2013ish. The [/talk forum](https://wololo.net/talk/) used to be a vibrant community full of hobby programmers. There's also the separate [Wagic forum](https://wololo.net/forum/), which was focused on developing the digital card game [Wagic: the Homebrew?!](https://github.com/WagicProject/wagic/releases). Run by [@frwololo](https://twitter.com/frwololo)
- [Explorium](https://www.explorium.co.uk/); my former employers, a growth-mindset-focused creative learning centre and training provider for Primary and Secondary school children. We did some incredible work there, and helped many kids discover their creative potential. Check them out!
- [CHEF-KOCH's Technology News](https://chef-koch.bearblog.dev/), a technology news outlet (also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CKsTechNews), [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/CKsTechNews/) and [other social media](https://opencollective.com/cks-technology-news#about)) where CHEF-KOCH reports on the cutting edge of technology in a concise, readable and helpful manner. Head and shoulders above all other tech news these days.
