Hello! The site admin is Darthagnon.

This is my blog and technical portfolio, where I seek to inform, entertain, and share my handicrafts and knowledge with you. I like to create robot "heroes" from recycled materials, write legends and draw pictures of them. To keep good old machines running for a long time - without puppet strings attached - you could also use some of my tips and tricks for computer software and hardware. Or cook yourself a delicious vegan recipe or two, gathered from across the globe. I'll also wax lyrical about esoteric literature and nerdy hobbies on occasion.

## What's with the username?
I like to go by the Sith version of the 4th Musketeer, D'Artagnan. It's obviously not my real name.
