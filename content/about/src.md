Site source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/robot-one/robot-one.github.io), as well as offline backups on my home systems. Snapshots are also available on [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/*/robot-one.github.io) and [Archive.today](https://archive.today/3lBgJ). The site uses 2 themes, [Hugo Theme Dream](https://github.com/Darthagnon/hugo-theme-dream) and [Hugo Easy Gallery](https://github.com/Darthagnon/hugo-easy-gallery), and is built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.
