## About *A Pilgrim's Progress, Retold*

[John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pilgrim%27s_Progress) is an allegory, a symbolic story of a Christian Everyman's journey through life's struggles and temptations until reaching Heaven.

It is a revered classic of English literature, alongside [Shakespeare](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_bibliography) and the [King James Bible](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version), but suffers from similar problems to these other classics: Ye Olde Englyshe, which is a very different language to today, and requires effort and patience even for native speakers to understand.

[Geraldine McCaughrean's retelling of Pilgrim's Progress](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/446622.A_Pilgrim_s_Progress) is a very well-written tale I enjoyed as a child, having borrowed it from the local library to read in 2005 or so.

It is almost movie-like in its narrative and illustrations, entertaining and educational for both children and adults, and short enough.

You will become familiar with the gist of the original story, and be more able to enjoy it, should you ever read it.

For the moment, though, enjoy this allegory, and see if you can recognize the morals and Biblical references herein.

PS. If you wish to read this book, there's digital copies on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/johnbunyanspilgr0000mcca) and [Z-Library](https://z-lib.org/). I used [ABBYY Finereader 15 OCR Editor](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBYY_FineReader) and [Sigil](https://sigil-ebook.com/sigil/) to create the EPUB version you'll find, from the PDF scans of the book from Archive.org. No direct links, though, so you'll have to do a little bit of searching if you want it; there is no official Kindle copy as of writing.
