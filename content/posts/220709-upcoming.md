# Revisionist History: upcoming articles
A list to cross off, to track articles that I'm adding here, and their chronology.

<!--more-->

You may have noticed the dates being a bit off on some of the articles. Sometimes, I republish stuff I wrote a long time ago elsewhere. Other times, I start writing something and don't finish it until much later, but keep the original date. Or maybe an old article needed a minor update. I try and note these issues where necessary.

I've also been updating the website theme, making it snazzier. If you're technically minded and want to compare changes, [here's what it looked like before](https://web.archive.org/web/20220316012810/http://robot-one.github.io/) (see also [Archive.today](https://archive.ph/zIgCi) and [here's my changelog](https://github.com/Darthagnon/hugo-theme-dream/tree/production) (105 commits ahead) versus [the original Dream theme](https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream)

## Update your bookmarks!
NB. I recently decided to change the URL scheme for articles, namely instead of being `article-name`, they are all now renamed to `yymmdd-article-name`, so that they appear chronologically on my filesystem. I could use folders, but then there would be no way of viewing them as a flat list. (Plus, I may use folders later on, to sort series of articles). So, if you've bookmarked/favourited anything on this website, please update your bookmarks; at least it's early days, so I figured best to do it now.
