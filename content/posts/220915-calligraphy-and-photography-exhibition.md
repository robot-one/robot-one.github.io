Yesterday, there was a photo exhibition by the Somerset Art Group. It is a group started by colleagues and good friends from Seetec-Pluss, and I was invited to help out and exhibit there. The above photos are a collage of my work that was exhibited, alongside many other, more talented, photographers.

## While we were there, calligraphy
Always over-prepared, the old bag full of arts equipment, fountain pens, and pages of Tolkien's *Fellowship of the Ring* came in handy for an impromptu calligraphy demonstration for a friend's YouTube Channel. Here is the video, **[Darren's Calligraphy Skills](https://youtu.be/OsamqC3_Ed4)**:

## More info about the group

The [YEAST Scrap Store](https://yeastscrapstore.co.uk/) in Glastonbury, Somerset, is a community hub for creative events, and the HQ for an art group started as part of the [Engage Somerset](https://somerset.referralwebsite.co.uk/) initiative ([more info](https://pluss.org.uk/engage-somerset/engage-somerset-is-officially-launched/)). 

I was invited along by a good friend and colleague who was running some workshops at the DWP Job Centre while I was doing my work placement there. 

With the sunsetting of Engage Somerset, the art group has been handed over to the community to run, along with a walking group (and others!). The exhibition featured nature photography from the walking group, good food, speeches, promotional workshops and stimulating conversation.

## Cookie recipe
I brought along a kind of fruit and nut cookie, based off a Mallorcan recipe for *carquinyolis* given me by one of my best friends. *My apologies, M. for butchering your recipe! Somehow, it still tastes nice.*

### Dry ingredients:
- 600g flour
- 250g sugar
- 200g-ish sunflower seeds, dried apricots, raisins, candied citrus rind, etc. etc.
- 2 small chopped apples
- 2 Tbsp sodium bicarbonate
- 2 Tbsp-ish crushed fennel seeds
- a generous sprinkling of dried chilli flakes and/or cayenne pepper powder (optional). 
- You can also add a little bit of nutmeg or any other spices you feel like adding
- pinch of salt 

### Wet ingredients:
- a little olive oil
- 2 small oranges, juiced (optional)
- 6 Tbsp flax seeds, ground

### Preparation:
1. Boil ground flax seeds in 1 cup of water for about 10mins. They should become thick and goopy - this is an egg replacement, `1Tbsp ground flax seed` works as replacement for `1 egg` as a binding agent.
2. Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly.
3. Mix in the wet ingredients, orange juice last (it is acidic and will react with the baking soda). 
	- Because I tend to add too much liquid, I have now instructed you to add too much liquid. Add more flour as needed - it is supposed to be quite dry, almost to the point of worry.
4. Roll out the dough on a floured surface into roughly baguette shapes, flatten slightly, and place on greasepaper in trays, cut a line along the top and bake for... no idea. Until they're done-ish, probably around 45mins. Then, slice into small slices and bake a little longer to dry them out.
5. Leave to cool and become crunchy. Then eat!
