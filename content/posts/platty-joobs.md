Who cares? Still, there's a good song... ![Union Jack](/img/logos/United-Kingdom.gif)

**Her Royal Highness Elizabeth "Liz" Alexandra Mary Mountbatten-Windsor II, Queen of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, of the House Saxe-Coburg and Gotha** has celebrated her Platinum Jubilee at age 96. 

Queen Liz has a mainly ceremonial/symbolic role.

> Actual ruling is done by a bunch of self-serving malicious fools called Parliament. I'm not very hopeful for the future of England; it's a shadow of the great Empire it once was; subservient to the USA; Brexit is a mess; the right to protest is dying ([Police, Crimes and Sentencing Bill 2022]); freedom of speech is not guaranteed (e.g. [Mark Meechan's offensive humour], BBC 20/03/2018); and the government is planning to make changes to the Human Rights Act 1998 ([Amnesty hits out at Tory plans to replace Human Rights Act], The Guardian 27/03/2022). The same right honourable gentlemen who awarded under-the-table VIP contracts to supply medical equipment to their friends (PPE scandal, e.g. [Government's PPE VIP lane unlawful , court rules], BBC 12/01/2022) and are trying to dodge accountability for partying while the nation suffered under their own totalitarian rules (e.g. see this [Partygate timeline], BBC 19/05/2022). 

The Queen effectively just rubber-stamps what Parliament proposes. She has done well to keep herself fairly apolitical, publicly unopinionated, and likeable. For some reason, my dad thinks she's a vampire on his nuttier days. She's done okay, not been a [King John], and her castles and family are a nice piece of history and English culture. But Freddie's a better queen ðŸ˜…. 

Here's the English national anthem, *God Save the Queen*, taken from Queen's *A Night At The Opera* and live rendition from *Hungarian Rhapsody*, as well as the alternative national anthem, Elgar's *Jerusalem*, sung by Libera (formerly Angel Voices):

This is also a test for a new website audio embedding system I've been working hard on for my friend's podcast website, [dragonsnotincluded.github.io](https://dragonsnotincluded.github.io/) (WIP). It works as a [Hugo module], and can be found [here, on GitHub](https://github.com/Darthagnon/darths-hugo-shortcodes) for use with other static websites built with [Hugo].
