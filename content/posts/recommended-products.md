It's not like in the good old days, is it? Every now and again, I come across something better, and wish someone had told me about it sooner.

<!--more-->

This article is going to be a very long and ongoing list of products I've been recommended or personally use. No affiliate nonsense, just good quality. I might occasionally link some information references or obscure products, but overall, I recommend doing your own research.

Buy second-hand if possible, it's cheaper, usually charity-run - so (hopefully) someone in need will benefit a little, rather than a soulless, faceless corporation that doesn't need more money. The UK is very good with charity shops, car-boot sales, lots of bargains to be had.

## Food
- **My favourite chocolate is Montezuma Absolute Black 100% Cocoa**. Only brand I've ever seen that makes 100% cocoa chocolate, no sugar, no milk, no palm oil, not even cocoa butter (no idea how); ingredients: 100% cocoa solids. Very bitter, very good, very expensive for a bar of chocolate (£2.50/100g in Q4 2019, now £2.79/90g in Q1 2022)
- **Tesco 85% chocolate for £1** - it's got sugar and cocoa butter, but it's bitter enough for my taste and much cheaper than the other. Most of the Tesco's own brand chocolate range is pretty good, and simultaneously cheap.
- Allegedly, **Branston baked beans** are better than Heinz' baked beans [4] (I've noticed the "lite" version of Heinz, with stevia or something instead of sugar is kinda flavourless)

## Shoes
- **Avoid modern Doc Martens**. They are now Made In China. [1]
> [Solovair](https://uk.nps-solovair.com/) is the real Doc Martens and used to make them. After Doc moved to Asia and cut ties, the factory kept on making boots in England under Solovair. They've got some real heritage and have maintained the quality. [2]

- **Good work boots: Redwing, Cheany, Trickers, Loake (half the price of Churches-brand), Goodyear-welted Boulder V12** [3].
>  owt that comes out of Northampton is pretty much guaranteed "buy it for life" quality.

- The best shoes I've ever worn were **£15 Clarks**, comfortable, lightweight, good-looking, but they didn't last, and neither have most of the other more expensive Clarks shoes I've worn, typically wearing through the fancypants "air cushions" in the soles. Moral: **Don't get expensive shoes from Clarks, though cheap ones might be good.**

## Shaving
Modern Gilette is far from the best a man can get. I used to get cuts, irritation, razor burn from wet shaving with a Gilette Mach 5; no-one ever told me you're supposed to shave in the direction of the hair, not against it. Switched to electric beard trimmer and kept stubble for the rest of my teen years. Got tired of the electric mangling my stubble, suspect it caused split ends, so I'm currently testing out old 1960s safety razors, the ones with the suicide blades. So far, so good. Much better than what I remember the multi-bladed modern razor being. **Best models are "vintage" Gilette or PAL double-edge safety razor**, Made In England; I got a very good deal on eBay (£10 for a small collection of 4). 

## Perfume
I like hosing myself Armani Code Profumo and Jean-Paul Gaultier when going through airport perfume shops, but the smells are too bloody expensive. Cheaper clones that I've heard smell the same include:

- QPS Amazing Code ([Quality Perfume Scents Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/qualityperfumescents/))
- [Perfume Parlour Sweet Milan For Men 1418](https://www.perfume-parlour.co.uk/sweet-milan-for-men-1418)
- [Magic Code Prive](https://www.ebay.com/p/24033841864) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV5qTylezEk
- Cuba Gold
- Fujiyama Gentleman
- Ermenegildo Zegna Zegna Intenso https://www.fragrantica.com/board/viewtopic.php?id=185247
- HIM (His Imperial Majesty) Reserve British Sterling Cologne for men
- Vialli Black
- Black Sun by Salvador Dali (better than Zegna)
- Bod Man Black
- Avoid [Milton Lloyd's Bondage Homme](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Milton-Lloyd-Cosmetics-Bondage-Homme-Toilette/dp/B0030G7LKI) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQlsaWbk4ck (deodorant bottle) and [Milton-Lloyd Colour Me Gold Homme](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Colour-Homme-Gold-Toilette-Spray/dp/B00F992MV2)

## Writing
I rediscovered fountain pens in 2021, thanks to a dear friend leaving behind a few for me, and they write just like the expensive unrecyclable Mitsubishi UniBall pens I liked, but instead of throwing them out, I can refill them with bottled ink and look like a dumb hipster nerd while trying to get them to write on a scrap of paper. 

**Get a fountain pen.** (get a converter, eyedropper or syringe while you're at it, to refill from bottles of ink). 

**Caveat: Standard fountain pen ink is not waterproof, even if it looks just like permanent rollerball or biro ink you're used to.** If you spill your drink on your biro/pencil report, it will survive. If it rains on your fountain-written thesis, it's gone. Er... likewise for that cheque you just signed. Unless you buy more expensive ink. I use mine mainly for art, calligraphy and story manuscripts.

- Get a cheap one first to see if you like it. I was given an old Parker Vector, and found a Helix Oxford.
- Don't buy a brand-new Parker Vector for £20.00 from WH Smith; you're paying for fancy packaging. You can get them for under £5.00 from LIDL, or vintage from eBay or private sellers for around £10
- If you like fountains, get "vintage" pens. They're fancier and better quality than most modern versions. Usually cheaper, as well, though you need to take a little care or be willing to fix them yourself.
- The only modern fountain pens really worth getting are Japanese brands. Western brands have conglomerated and outsource their manufacturing or do so to lower standards.
- Avoid obscure brands. I thought Poenari (Romanian brand, named for the inventor of the 1st fountain pen) looked nice, but they're allegedly "kit pens", i.e. manufactured from off-the-shelf materials and parts. So nothing special.

## Computers
**Apple Mac is overpriced, but worth it if you want something that "just works"**. Good models include:

### Placeholder for list, my little brother bought one and did the research

IBM, one of the old grand-daddies of the computer world, used to make high-quality, reliable Thinkpads. It rebranded to Lenovo, who still makes **Lenovo Thinkpads. Good for work laptops.**

**Avoid HP and slim, single-fan plastic laptops.** I personally have had an HP Pavilion DM4 (2010, custom model from Comet shop) which lasted until it cooked its dedicated graphics card in 2018ish, due to overheating. Most non-Apple laptops are plastic, which holds heat nicely. Despite DVD drives going the way of the dinosaur, many still have only a single spindly fan to cool their guts; unless it's a good brand with good fans and plenty of grilles, it's gonna heat up.

I'm reasonably happy with my DELL Inspiron 15 Gaming 2nd gen (2018), whose line has been succeeded by the very similar DELL G15 line. It's powerful, well ventilated, easily accessible, comfortable keyboard. Issues: not enough metal in the construction. DELL XPS has more metal, but is much more expensive and recent models have very few USB ports.

## Videogames
 - Buy directly from Indie developers (usually [itch.io] or [Steam])
 - Get 1 or 2 free games every week from Epic Games
 - If possible, buy from GOG.com rather than Steam - GOG games work anywhere, forever, and you can share them with friends. Steam games require internet verification that you own the games before playing.
 - Piracy sounds sinister, but will get you a better gaming experience. Note that it may be a legal grey area, depending on where you live. Does Ubisoft/EA/PopCap/Google/Microsoft really need your money?
 - Get an old games console (PSP, 3DS, 2DS, PS2, PS3, PS Vita, Wii, Wii U) and teach yourself hacking. Guides are available on many dedicated community sites (Wololo.net for Playstation, everything step-by-step on [hacks.guide](https://hacks.guide/)


## Telephones
**Get something you can swap the battery in.** Smartphones suck and are timewasters, and may (*say conspiracy theorists*) or may not (*say company shills*) cause cancer. Lithium ion batteries die quickly, usable charge only lasts 5 years or so. Your mileage will vary; my Sony PSP 3000 from 2008 and iPad 4 from 2013 still have good batteries. Both of my laptops have had unusable batteries within 2 years. The rest of the gold, copper and silicon can run indefinitely; the glass or USB port will break first. Recent models include

I have kept an extensive list called `The Best Android iPhones.txt`, which I will eventually edit and publish here, but for the moment, I cannot recommend a specific model. Use [iFixIt](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide) and YouTube to look for `productname teardown/battery replacement` to
