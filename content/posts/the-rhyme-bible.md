## Introduction

I and my brothers grew up listening to The Rhyme Bible and enjoying Toni Goffe's hilarious illustrations. It's a fun collection of Bible stories for children, written in lilting verse.

You can find a copy of [The Rhyme Bible on the Internet Archive] (ISBN 0-88070-829-8, published by Gold'n'Honey Books, 1996).

Recorded in 3 sessions on Friday, 19 Nov 2021, and edited after recording until 1900, for my niece to listen to in my absence. 

I used the brilliant software [mp3DirectCut] to cut and splice the 320kbps master MP3 files without losing any quality, as it doesn't re-encode. I corresponded with the software author, Mr. Martin Pesch, back in September 2021 and he very kindly fixed some bugs that I'd found, which helped a lot with my work on the first audiobook. 

> "First?" 

Indeed. This is the 3rd audiobook I have recorded recently. The other two, [*Shakespeare Stories*] and [*A Pilgrim's Progress, Retold*] will be re-published here shortly.

My voice recorder is an Olympus DM-670 I was given by a government grant for University in 2015ish (?) and which I used, on and off, to record lectures until the Head of Department sent a stroppy email to "everyone" in 2018, condemning the practice. It gathered dust for a while, then when I was alone and had no-one to read to, I started recording literature.
