      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, there was a photo exhibition by the Somerset Art Group. It is a group started by colleagues and good friends from Seetec-Pluss, and I was invited to help out and exhibit there. The above photos are a collage of my work that was exhibited, alongside many other, more talented, photographers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
